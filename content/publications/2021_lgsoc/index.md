# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: LGSOC is a rare tumor subtype with high case fatality rates in patients with metastatic disease. Here, we use multiomics integration of whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometryâ€“based proteomics on LGSOC cell lines to elucidate novel biomarkers and therapeutic vulnerabilities.
