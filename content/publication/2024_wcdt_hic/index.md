abstract: The impact of variations in the three-dimensional structure of the genome has been recognized, but solid cancer tissue studies are limited. Here, we performed integrated deep Hi-C sequencing with matched whole-genome sequencing, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) sequencing and RNA sequencing across a cohort of 80 biopsy samples from patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Dramatic differences were present in gene expression, 5-methylcytosine/5hmC methylation and in structural variation versus mutation rate between A and B (open and closed) chromatin compartments. A subset of tumors exhibited depleted regional chromatin contacts at the AR locus, linked to extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) and worse response to AR signaling inhibitors. We also identified topological subtypes associated with stark differences in methylation structure, gene expression and prognosis. Our data suggested that DNA interactions may predispose to structural variant formation, exemplified by the recurrent TMPRSS2â€“ERG fusion. This comprehensive integrated sequencing effort represents a unique clinical tumor resource.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We discovered a group of metastatic prostate cancer patients with lower levels of DNA-DNA interactions around the Androgen Receptor (AR) gene, the main driver of prostate cancer. Interestingly, this group had an abundance of circular DNA outside of the chromosomes (extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA)) that included parts of the AR gene resulting in AR gene amplification and become very active, which might explain why their cancer was resistant to treatment.
